# TV-Script-Generation-using-RNN

## Description

In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data. 

Imagine you work for a production company, and your job is to write a script for one of their television shows. You could write the script manually or you could just have a computer do it for you. In the third project, you'll generate a TV script using a recurrent neural network. You'll train the network on existing scripts, then use it to generate an original piece of writing. 

## Flow of the code
